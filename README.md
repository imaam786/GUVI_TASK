# GUVI_TASK!

Problem Statement :
Create a signup page where a user can register, a login page to
log in with the necessary details needed during registration.
Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should
contain additional details such as age, dob, contact, etc. The user
can update,
Flow : Register > Login > Profile

Condition:

● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the
codes must co-exist in the same file.

● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage
of form submission).

● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to
maintain page responsiveness.

● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the
details of the user profiles

● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL
statements.

● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage
(Do not use PHP Session)

● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.




*****NOTE*****

I have done the both front-end and back-end for the condition, but redis is not used because i just learning in to it.
Almost satisfied the condition given, in future i will definitely work for the requirements and satisfy the requirements.
